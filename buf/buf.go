// Package buf provides pooled byte buffers with explicit ownership.
//
// Ownership rules:
//
//  1. Borrowed: data handed to a callback (for example udp.Packet.Data) is
//     valid only until the callback returns. Never Release it; Copy it to keep it.
//  2. Owned: a *Buf from Get or Copy has exactly one owner, who must call
//     Release exactly once.
//  3. Transfer: handing a *Buf to someone else (for example pushing it into a
//     queue) transfers ownership. If the transfer fails, ownership stays with
//     the caller, who must still Release it.
//
// Build with -tags netxdebug to panic on double Release and to count
// outstanding buffers.
